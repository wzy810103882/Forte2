This is a tutorial level that teaches player to generate four tracks of the background music by killing four different types of enemies when they are blinking. 

arrow keys control the movement of the character, up key is jump and jump generates a bass sound.

A and S keys throw a music note to left or right and when the music note hits the enemy, the enemy disappears while activates a part of the background track, depending on the type of enemy hit (There are four types). Colliding with an enemy also kills the enemy. The enemy respawns later in the map after being killed.

A and S keys generate another bass note.

Z and X are quick downward dash. 

attach feature is implemented (character throws music note)
timing enemy attack is implemented (only generates music when killing enemy when blinking)
One legit level is implemented (tutorial level with scrolling feature and obstacles)
opportunity for dissonance (dissonant sound when hitting enemy at the wrong timing)
